# Blackfox Tech

## Executive Summary

*Our parent company exeter wishes for us to develop a clean and elegant solution for students to be able to communicate with one another, our primary focus will be a web platform but we will also be branching into the phone market with a native iOS and Android app. We will first start by deciding a layout and features then we will move on to what primary language we wish to use. We will create two different versions in two different primary languages to test combatability and stability. We will then begin work on the UI and UX.*

## Business Objectives

*Our primary objective is to develop and deploy a web communication app for our students, we must make sure that we
-Develope a clean and stable code
-An app that can be easily maintained
-An elegant web design that is responsive for mobile users*

## Background

*Exeter has informed us that we need to increase the communication of our students and to give them more of an opportunity to relay code back and forth amongst themselves.*

## Scope

*We should be including a standard "wall" system where multiple users posts and/or code snippets can be posted and commented on, we should also implement a private version of this utility that should be visible to people who add eachother as "friends." There should also be a utility where users can private message one another. We should also plan on implementing a way for teachers and mentors to be able to group students by region, state, country, or city.*

## Functional requirements

*
The UI needs to consist of
-Top bar approx 6px tall to be used as a navbar
-the navbar will consits of 5 different tabs, please do not go above 5 tabs, please align these listed tabs to the left of the navbar.
  -"EXETERSTUDENT"
  -"LINKED"ie the friends tab
  -"MY PROFILE"
  -"CODE CENTER"
  -"THE WALL"ie stream of user content
-on the right of the navbar there should be two tabs seperate from the rest, a tab on the second to the right that says "LOGIN" and a tab that is to the farthest to the right next to it that says  "SUPPORT"

The TOP and required features before release are
-THE WALL which will allow users and students to see the posts and comments of other students
-LINKED which is the private version of the wall where students have to add eachother to be able to see content in this area
-MY PROFILE which will allow the users to custimze information about themselves and add pictures
-CODE CENTER which is where students can swap code snippets
-A instant message and private message system that will allow students to privately communicate
-PLEASE do not forgot about the login system!

The website will be developed with
-Java as the server backend
-we will also be using apache
-We will be using MySQL as our database and PhPMyAdmin as the database manager
-Of course we will be using html5 and css3 aswell as JS
-We will be using the W3.CSS framework to develope any and all UI*


## Personnel requirements

*We will require a dedicated development team of atleast 5 peaople, 2 QA, 2 graphic designers, 5 support staff*

## Delivery schedule

*List of dev stages
-Planning "incert random date here"
-Developing twin apps begins "incert another date here"
-prototesting twin apps "you can guess"
-bug fixing and qa testing "more dates"
-public alpha testing"another date"
-beta testing "date"
-final qa testing before deployment "test"
-DEPLOYMENT!!!!"date"*

## Other requirements

*Do keep in mind we need to make sure that the website has good speed ratings and load quickly and cleanly, we will also need to make sure that we make this a responsive web design for easy mobile and app integration.*

## Limitations

*We may be crunched on our disk space to host this, so if you can compress or due without, please try, some big issues we may have are hosting. *

## Risks

*Our biggest risk is self hosting our login system which will be capable of accessing users personel information, we will need to use a strong 256bit encryption to secure and protect our users data, any breachs WILL fall back on us as the developers.*
